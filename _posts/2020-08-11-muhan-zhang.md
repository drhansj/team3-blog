This is the first day of the MSSE Bootcamp, and also this is my first blog! I feel honored to introduce my fantastic teammate -- Xudong Zhuang!

Xudong and I both live in China, but in different regions. He lived in Xiamen, Fujian Province, a coastal city of prominence and properity. I always wanted to go there for its outstanding landscape and breezy lifestyle! He told me he doesn't have pets and have no intention of keeping one as well. He thinks that his taste is more similar to those from Southeast Asian. Among all delicacy, he likes curry chicken the most. He does not have his least favorite food. This really makes me surprised because he believes all food can taste good if cooked properly. 

We both love arts! That is very inspiring for me because I tend to listen to music all day long. I feel great when I'm immersed in music and try to make grooves to its rhythm. But more impressively, he is definitely a master in playing instruments! He has been playing piano for 18 years, the French horn for 10 years. He was absolutely a top member in both high school and university symphony orchestra, coorperated with some top-tier musicians in China! His enthusiasm in music and art is far beyond my imagination, and I admire these sophisticated experience so much!!!

When it comes to his choice for MSSE, during his undergraduate study, he found that current molecular simulation packages or softwares are extremely time-consuming. Therefore, he intends to reduce the computational expense and accelerate the development of computational chemistry or materials science. Plus, he believes that deep learning can play a vital role in this field! We both are keen on arts and science. I believe a fantastic collaboration will take place!
